  <ul>
    <li><strong>I like meeting new people and making friends!</strong> If you’re chill, then I'm chill and we’ll get along just fine so don't be scared to approach. For PT players: I’m cool with INT, C+H, and W2I!</li>
    <li><strong>If you are curious about any of my OCs feel free to ask me! Not all of them have detailed background/information, but most do and I love sharing about them.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>I enjoy media but don’t fw drama.</strong> I like what I like without obsessing over it. Toxic stan culture, media activism and petty online discourses don’t interest me. I am NOT about to start dropping every piece of media just because YOU don't like it or the creator is deemed "problematic". There are bigger issues in life and morality debates over fiction are honestly stupid.</li>
    <li><strong>My coping mechanism is DARK humor which is why I use tonetags to avoid miscommunication. (But generally you don't have to use tonetags with me.)</li>
    <li><strong>I have the memory of a goldfish.</strong> If I forget something, just remind me instead of getting annoyed. I genuenely don't remember shit sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>If I cross a boundary, tell me like an adult.</strong> Passive-aggressive behavior won’t be tolerated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">❌ NO NO List: <img src="https://blinkies.cafe/b/display/0106-vicioussmiley.gif" alt="My Blinkie"> </h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't involve or drag me into things I am not involved with. IDC about drama.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>I don't fw harassment of any kind.</strong> So if someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me but don’t harass/attack me over it; I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li><strong>Minors DNI.</strong> I don’t interact with anyone under (17+). If I find out you’re a minor, you’re getting blocked, no discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>I perma-block/hide people freely.</strong> If I don’t like you for WHATEVER reason, you’re gone and I'm moving on with my life. I don’t owe you my time or energy and I refuse to engage with people who annoy me.</li>
    <li><strong>I am NOT American.</strong> I'm Slavic (Eastern European), and I do NOT care about American culture, social norms, or politics. If you think everyone should conform/courtesy to your standards, then DNI.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus DNI if you don't agree with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xkHZT1l.jpeg">THIS</a> as well.</li>
