  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown!<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

<div align="left">
  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴏ ɴᴏ ʟɪsᴛ:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I don't care abt drama and don't want to be dragged into any! (Shocking.. I know.)</li>
    <li>I don't fw harassment of <strong>any</strong> kind! IF someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me, but don't associate me with it and/or harass me and keep me out of your dramas; I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li>Do NOT expect me to blindly block people unless they have acted on an actual, proven crime, rather than some childish antics or chronically online squabbles on the internet.</li>
    <li>I don't interact with people below 17+ and I will hide you <strong>immediately</strong> if you are a minor.</li>
    <li>I like what I like and you like what you like, don't try to force your opinions on mine.</li>
    <li>Respect is earned, not given + the basic DNI criteria.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>I AM open to making new friends and I am cool with INT, C+H and W2I! (Preferably because it helps me track our converstation better!).
    <li>I like many things, but I do not consider myself a part of any fandoms. I'm more of a casual, laid-back fan.</li>
    <li>I separate the art from the artist when it comes to the problematic majority; And I'm certainly NOT about to start dropping every piece of media every time a creator turns out to be piece of shit for the sake of ''morality'' on the internet. Go back to your twitter corner.</li>
  </ul>

      <li>I am Neurodivergent with CPTSD + GAD + CEN + Agoraphobia; I will be a bit guarded with you at first, but I will gradually open up if I deem you trustworthy over time.</li>
      <li>I'm a victim of SA + SH (multiple times) along with a <strong>severe</strong> trauma from a pedophile, stalking, and a familial/generational trauma so please be a <em>little</em> mindful of your pointed jokes, unless you are a close friend. Otherwise, I'm <strong>/gen</strong> chill and OK with dark humor because it's also my coping mechanism.</li>
