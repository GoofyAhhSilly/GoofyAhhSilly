  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown! Or somewhere else...<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

<div align="left">
  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴏ ɴᴏ ʟɪsᴛ:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>I don't care about drama and don't want to be dragged into any.</strong> (the fact that I'm forced to add this bc some people have 0 common fucking sense istg)</li>
    <li>I don't fw harassment of <strong>any</strong> kind; IF someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me, but don't associate me with it and/or harass me and keep me out of your dramas. I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li>Do NOT expect me to blindly side/agree with people unless they have acted on an actual, proven crime, rather than some childish antics or chronically online squabbles on the internet.</li>
    <li>I don't interact with people below 17+ and I will block/hide you <strong>immediately</strong> if you are a minor.</li>
    <li>I like what I like and you like what you like; don't force your opinions.</li>
    <li>Respect is earned, not given + my basic DNI criteria: Pedophile, Zoophile, Racist, Sexist, Ableist, Discrimination, etc. Also, I practically abuse the perma-hide button so if I don't like you for whatever reason it's bye-bye and I'm moving on with my life. IDGAF. </li>
    <li>I would like to remind you that I am NOT American and that I shouldn't be forced to agree with your culture. I am SLAVIC; Bulgarian, a person from Eastern Europe. I have a completely different life style, culture, perspective and mindset. DNI if you're overly sensitive.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>I like meeting new people and making new friends and I'm cool with INT, C+H, and W2I! < (this is for PT players.)</li>
    <li>I like many things, but I don't consider myself a part of any fandom. I'm more of a casual laid-back fan.</li>
    <li>I separate the art from the artist when it comes to the problematic majority; And I'm certainly NOT about to start dropping every piece of media every time a creator turns out to be piece of shit for the sake of ''morality'' on the INTERNET. There are better, more important things to worry about in life.</li>
    <li>My coping mechanism is DARK humor; If you can't handle it, please walk away.</li>
    <li>I have the memory of a goldfish so if I happen to forget something in our conversation please remind me.</li>
    <li>Communication is KEY and we are all adults here; That being said, I <strong>can't</strong> know if I said something wrong or crossed a boundary if you don't communicate it. Childish behaviour will <strong>not</strong> be tolerated and this is your only warning.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm Neurodivergent with CPTSD + GAD + Agoraphobia; I'll be guarded around you at first, but I will gradually open up if I deem you trustworthy over time.</li>
      <li>I'm a victim of SA + SH (multiple times) along with a <strong>severe</strong> trauma from a pedophile + stalking and humiliation, so be a <em>little</em> mindful of your pointed jokes UNLESS you are a close friend. Otherwise, I'm chill and OK with dark humor because like I said, it's my coping mechanism.</li>
      <li>I would like to clarify that I am NOT looking for sympathy and you don't have to tiptoe around me at all but acknowledgment/awareness is appreciated. I'm adding this section ONLY for the sake of letting people know what they're dealing with. I've had people blindly start to argue with me in regards of those topics like they have the ''moral high ground'' even though I AM someone who has gone through these experiences first-hand.</li>
      <li>I'm gonna let you know right away that I don't believe in god, I don't care about the bible, or Christianity. I am a LaVeyan Satanist. If that bothers you, walk away. I couldn't care less about what people think of me and my beliefs LMAO.</li>
