  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown! Or somewhere else...<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

  <h2 style="color: green; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">✅ OK List: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z3TrtGJ.gif" alt="My Blinkie"></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>I like meeting new people and making friends!</strong> If you’re chill, then I'm chill and we’ll get along just fine. I’m cool with INT, C+H, and W2I by default UNLESS I specifically have DNIUF in my name!</li>
    <li><strong>I enjoy media but don’t fw drama.</strong> I like what I like without obsessing over it. Toxic stan culture, media activism and petty online discourses don’t interest me. I am NOT about to start dropping every piece of media just because YOU don't like it or the creator is deemed "problematic". There are larger world issues and morality debates over fiction are honestly stupid.</li>
    <li><strong>My coping mechanism is DARK humor and I use tonetags to avoid miscommunication. (But generally YOU don't have to use tonetags with me.)</li>
    <li><strong>I have the memory of a goldfish.</strong> If I forget something, just remind me instead of getting annoyed. I genuenely don't remember shit sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>If I cross a boundary, tell me like an adult.</strong> Passive-aggressive behavior won’t be tolerated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">❌ NO NO List: <img src="https://blinkies.cafe/b/display/0106-vicioussmiley.gif" alt="My Blinkie"> </h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don't involve or drag me into things I am not involved with. I don't care about drama.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>I don't fw harassment of any kind.</strong> So if someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me but don’t harass/attack me over it; I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li><strong>Minors DNI.</strong> I don’t interact with anyone under (17+). If I find out you’re a minor, you’re getting blocked, no discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>I perma-block/hide people freely.</strong> If I don’t like you for WHATEVER reason, you’re gone and I'm moving on with my life. I don’t owe you my time or energy and I refuse to engage with people who annoy me. (That being said, if I've hidden you then it's for my own reasons and peace of mind. So no, I won't unhide you even if you discover that I've hidden you, and I would appreciate it if you don't start up drama over it. Mind your life and let me move on with mine PEACEFULLY.)</li>
    <li><strong>I am NOT American.</strong> I'm Slavic (Eastern European), and I do NOT care about American culture, social norms, or politics. If you think everyone should conform/courtesy to your standards, then DNI.</li>           
    <li><strong>Bonus DNI if you don't agree with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xkHZT1l.jpeg">THIS</a> as well.</li>
