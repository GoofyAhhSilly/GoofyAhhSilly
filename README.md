  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown!<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

<div align="left">
  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴏ ɴᴏ ʟɪsᴛ:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I don't care about drama and don't want to be dragged into any! (Shocking... but it's even more shocking that I HAVE to add this to the list.)</li>
    <li>I don't fw harassment of <strong>any</strong> kind; IF someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me, but don't associate me with it and/or harass me and keep me out of your dramas. I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li>Do NOT expect me to blindly side/agree with people unless they have acted on an actual, proven crime, rather than some childish antics or chronically online squabbles on the internet.</li>
    <li>I don't interact with people below 17+ and I will hide you <strong>immediately</strong> if you are a minor.</li>
    <li>I like what I like and you like what you like; don't force your opinions.</li>
    <li>Respect is earned, not given + basic DNI criteria. Also, I practically abuse the perma-hide button so if I don't like you for whatever reason it's bye-bye and I'm moving on with my life.</li>
    <li>I would like to remind you that I am NOT American and that I shouldn't be forced to agree with your culture. I am SLAVIC; Bulgarian, a person from Eastern Europe. I have a completely different perspective, opinion, life style and culture.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>I like making new friends and I'm cool with INT, C+H, and W2I! (Preferably because it helps me track our converstation better.)
    <li>I like many things, but I don't consider myself a part of any fandoms. I'm more of a casual laid-back fan.</li>
    <li>I separate the art from the artist when it comes to the problematic majority; And I'm certainly NOT about to start dropping every piece of media every time a creator turns out to be piece of shit for the sake of ''morality'' on the INTERNET. There are better, more important things to worry about in life.</li>
    <li>My coping mechanism is DARK humor; If you can't handle it, please walk away.</li>
    <li>I have the memory of a goldfish so if I happen to forget or something in our converstation, please remind me.</li>
  </ul>

      <li>I'm Neurodivergent with CPTSD + GAD + Agoraphobia; I'll be guarded around you at first, but I will gradually open up if I deem you trustworthy over time.</li>
      <li>I'm a victim of SA + SH (multiple times) along with a <strong>severe</strong> trauma from a pedophile, stalking and humiliation, so please be a <em>little</em> mindful of your pointed jokes UNLESS you are a close friend. Otherwise, I'm <strong>/gen</strong> chill and OK with dark humor because like I said, it's my coping mechanism.</li>
