  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown! Or somewhere else...<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>I like meeting new people and making friends.</strong> If you’re chill, then I'm chill and we’ll get along just fine. (For PT players: I’m cool with INT, C+H, and W2I!)</li>
    <li><strong>I enjoy media but don’t fw fandom drama.</strong> I like what I like without obsessing over it. Toxic stan culture and petty chronically online discourses don’t interest me.</li>
    <li><strong>I separate art from the artist and problematic majority.</strong> I am NOT about to start dropping every piece of media just because the creator is a piece of shit. There are bigger issues in life and morality debates over fiction are honestly stupid and ridicilous.</li>
    <li><strong>My coping mechanism is DARK humor; If you can't handle it, please walk away. I really don’t care if ppl don’t like it.</li>
    <li><strong>My memory sucks.</strong> If I forget something in our conversation, just remind me instead of getting annoyed. I genuenely don't remember shit sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication is key.</strong> If I cross a boundary, tell me like an adult instead of acting like you have rocks in your mouth. Passive-aggressive behavior won’t be tolerated and this is your only warning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">❌ NO NO List: <img src="https://blinkies.cafe/b/display/0106-vicioussmiley.gif" alt="My Blinkie"> </h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>I don’t give a fuck about drama.</strong> Don't involve or drag me into shit I am not involved with.</li>
    <li><strong>I don't fw harassment of any kind.</strong> If someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me, but don’t harass/attack me over it; I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li><strong>I don’t blindly take sides.</strong> If there’s no actual, proven crime, I don’t care about your petty, chronically online fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Minors GTFO.</strong> I don’t interact with anyone under (17+). If I find out you’re a minor, you’re getting blocked, no discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect is earned, not given.</strong> I don’t care about your identity or pronouns or beliefs, if you’re an asshole, I will treat you like one.</li>
    <li><strong>I perma-block/hide people freely.</strong> If I don’t like you for WHATEVER reason, you’re gone. I don’t owe you my time or energy and I refuse to engage with people who annoy me. (I block/hide people for three main reasons: you're an unbearable toxic walking disaster, you're a minor who shouldn't be here, or you treat every conversation like a personal therapy session, none of which are my problem.</li>

</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Click to Reveal</summary>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I’m neurodivergent</strong> (+CPTSD, GAD, Agoraphobia). I’m guarded at first but will open up if I trust you over time.</li>
      <li><strong>I have severe trauma</strong> (SA, SH, stalking, emotional and pedophile-related abuse). I’m fine with dark humor, but don’t make pointed jokes unless we’re close.</li>
      <li><strong>I don’t want any pity or sympathy—just awareness. I'm adding this section ONLY for the sake of letting people know what they're dealing with. I’ve had people argue with me about these topics like they know better, despite never living through them. Don’t act like you have the "moral high ground" over my own experiences. Seriously, <strong>don't</strong> be that idiot.</li>
      <li><strong>I am NOT American.</strong> I am Slavic (Bulgarian, Eastern European), and I do NOT care about American culture, social norms, or politics. If you think everyone should conform/courtesy to your standards, DNI.</li>
      <li><strong>I’m a LaVeyan Satanist.</strong> I don’t believe in God, the Bible, or Christianity. If that bothers you, walk away.</li>
      <li><strong>If you’re overly sensitive or easily triggered, don’t interact.</strong> I’m blunt, opinionated, and unfiltered. So if that’s a problem, don’t engage. Just DNI.</li>
