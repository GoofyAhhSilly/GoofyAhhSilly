  <ul>
    <li><strong>I like meeting new people and making friends!</strong> If you’re chill, then I'm chill and we’ll get along just fine so don't be scared to approach. (For PT players: I’m cool with INT, C+H, and W2I!)</li>
    <li><strong>I enjoy media but don’t fw fandom drama.</strong> I like what I like without obsessing over it. Toxic stan culture and petty online discourses don’t interest me.</li>
    <li><strong>I separate art from the artist.</strong> I am NOT about to start dropping every piece of media just because the creator is a piece of shit or YOU don't like it. There are bigger issues in life and morality debates over fiction are honestly stupid.</li>
    <li><strong>My coping mechanism is DARK humor which is why I use tonetags to avoid miscommunication. (But generally you don't have to use tonetags with me.)</li>
    <li><strong>I have the memory of a goldfish.</strong> If I forget something, just remind me instead of getting annoyed. I genuenely don't remember shit sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>If I cross a boundary, tell me like an adult.</strong> Passive-aggressive behavior won’t be tolerated and this is your only warning.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>I don’t blindly take sides.</strong> If there’s no actual proven crime, then idc.</li>
    <li><strong>Minors DNI.</strong> I don’t interact with anyone under (17+). If I find out you’re a minor, you’re getting blocked, no discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>I don’t care about your identity or pronouns or beliefs,</strong> if you’re an asshole, I will treat you like one.</li>
    <li><strong>I perma-block/hide people freely.</strong> If I don’t like you for WHATEVER reason, you’re gone and I'm moving on with my life. I don’t owe you my time or energy and I refuse to engage with people who annoy me.</li>
    <li><strong>I am NOT American.</strong> I'm Slavic (Eastern European), and I do NOT care about American culture, social norms, or politics. If you think everyone should conform/courtesy to your standards, then DNI.</li>
