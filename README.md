  <p>HELLOOO... you probably encountered my GitHub on PonyTown! Or somewhere else...<br>
  Read the following to get to know me before you interact:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>I like meeting new people and making friends!</strong> If you’re chill, then I'm chill and we’ll get along just fine so don't be scared to approach. (For PT players: I’m cool with INT, C+H, and W2I!)</li>
    <li><strong>I enjoy media but don’t fw fandom drama.</strong> I like what I like without obsessing over it. Toxic stan culture and petty online discourses don’t interest me.</li>
    <li><strong>I separate art from the artist.</strong> I am NOT about to start dropping every piece of media just because the creator is a piece of shit or YOU don't like it. There are bigger issues in life and morality debates over fiction are honestly stupid.</li>
    <li><strong>My coping mechanism is DARK humor and I REALLY don’t care if you don’t like it.</li>
    <li><strong>I have the memory of a goldfish.</strong> If I forget something in our conversation, just remind me instead of getting annoyed. I genuenely don't remember shit sometimes.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication is key.</strong> If I cross a boundary, tell me like an adult instead of acting like you have rocks in your mouth. Passive-aggressive behavior won’t be tolerated and this is your only warning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">❌ NO NO List: <img src="https://blinkies.cafe/b/display/0106-vicioussmiley.gif" alt="My Blinkie"> </h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>IDGAF about drama.</strong> Don't involve or drag me into things I am not involved with.</li>
    <li><strong>I don't fw harassment of any kind.</strong> If someone on my friend list does something weird, you can inform me, but don’t harass/attack me over it; I am NOT responsible for the actions of others.</li>
    <li><strong>I don’t blindly take sides.</strong> If there’s no actual, proven crime, then I don’t care about your petty chronically online fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Minors GTFO.</strong> I don’t interact with anyone under (17+). If I find out you’re a minor, you’re getting blocked, no discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect is earned, not given.</strong> I don’t care about your identity or pronouns or beliefs, if you’re an asshole, I will treat you like one.</li>
    <li><strong>I perma-block/hide people freely.</strong> If I don’t like you for WHATEVER reason, you’re gone. I don’t owe you my time or energy and I refuse to engage with people who annoy me. (I block/hide people for three main reasons: you're an unbearable toxic walking disaster that <strong>constantly</strong> gets into or starts drama, you're a minor who shouldn't be here, or you treat every conversation like a personal therapy session, none of which are my problem.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>I’m neurodivergent</strong> (+CPTSD, GAD, Agoraphobia). I’m guarded at first but will open up if I trust you over time.</li>
      <li><strong>I have severe trauma from multiple things (SA included)</strong> but I rarely bring those up, and even if I happen to, you are by no means obligated to tiptoe or filter yourself around me. None of my friends do and I prefer it that way. Be yourselves.</li>
      <li><strong>I'm adding this section ONLY for the sake of letting people know what they're dealing with. That being said, don’t act like you have the "moral high ground" over my own experiences or how I cope with them. I also don't owe you the details of my trauma because at the end of the day it's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JnWGkGm.mp4">✨none of your business✨</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>I am NOT American.</strong> I'm Slavic (Eastern European), and I do NOT care about American culture, social norms, or politics. If you think everyone should conform/courtesy to your standards, DNI.</li>
      <li><strong>I’m a LaVeyan Satanist.</strong> I don’t believe in God, the Bible, or Christianity. If that bothers you, DNI.</li>
      <li><strong>If you’re overly sensitive or easily triggered, don’t interact.</strong> I make my own judgements based on your behaviour + I’m blunt and unfiltered. So if that’s a problem, just DNI.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus DNI if you don't agree with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xkHZT1l.jpeg">THIS</a> as well.</li>
